# Schnakenberg_Sim

This package generates a basic Turing Pattern model using the Schnakenberg System, as part of a group project for the SABS DTC Mathematical Biology Course.

## Schnakenberg System

We consider a trimolecular system that may display limit cycle behaviour:

_2X + Y ⇌ 3X_  
_X ⇌ A_  
_B → Y_  

A and B are in sufficient excess that their concentration is effectively constant. We may consider these reactions to be equivalent to standard formation and decay reactions: 

_∅ → A, A → ∅, ∅ → B_

This can be represented by the non-dimensional system of ODEs:
