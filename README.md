# Schnakenberg_Sim

This package generates a basic Turing Pattern model using the Schnakenberg System, as part of a group project for the SABS DTC Mathematical Biology Course.

## Schnakenberg System

We consider a trimolecular system that may display limit cycle behaviour:

_2X + Y â‡Œ 3X_
with formation and destruction reactions

This can be represented by the non-dimensional system of ODEs:
